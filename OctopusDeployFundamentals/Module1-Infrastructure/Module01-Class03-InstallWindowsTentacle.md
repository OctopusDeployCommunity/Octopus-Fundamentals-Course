# Octopus Deploy: Fundamentals
## Module 1: Infrastructure
### Class 3: Creating a Windows Tentacle Deployment Target

NOTE: For first pass, use existing fundamentals video. Redraft later for brand consistency!
Upon redraft:
- include more information on listening vs polling, visual examples and discuss use cases where one or the other might be more appropriate
- reference other supporting classes for other deployment targets, such as Linux Tentacles or offline package drops. Note that these are optional, supplimentary classes and will not be included on the quiz
