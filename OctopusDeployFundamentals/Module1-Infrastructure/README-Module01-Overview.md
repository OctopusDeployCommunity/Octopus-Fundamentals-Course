# Octopus Deploy: Fundamentals
## Module 1: Infrastructure

This is the first module of the Octopus Deploy Fundamentals training course.

In this module we cover Infrastructure. It will cover the fundamentals for managing the servers and services that Octopus deploys to. For example, this module will:

- Teach students how to manage environments, such as "Development", "Test" and "Production".
- Explain how to set up the communication between the Octopus Server or Cloud Instance and any target machines or cloud platforms (such as AWS, Azure or GCP).
- Discuss Workers and Worker Pools, and when it makes sense to use them.
