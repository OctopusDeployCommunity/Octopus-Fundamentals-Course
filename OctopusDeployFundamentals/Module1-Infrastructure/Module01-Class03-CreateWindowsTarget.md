## Module 1: Infrastructure
### Class 3: Creating a Windows Tentacle Deployment Target

Welcome to class 3 of this Infrastructure module for the Octopus Deploy Fundamentals training course. In this class we'll set up an Octopus "Tentacle" on a Windows server, so that we can deploy our application to that server.

This class assumes that you already understand how to set up Octopus Environments, and that you understand what is meant by the terms "Deployment Target" and "Machine Role" within Octopus Deploy. These topics have already been covered in classes 1 and 2.
